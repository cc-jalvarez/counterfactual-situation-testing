# Counterfactual Situation Testing

The *master* branch is the ongoing repository for CST. See the *eeamo2023* branch for the code of the ACM EAAMO 2023 version, [Counterfactual Situation Testing: Uncovering Discrimination under Fairness given the Difference](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3617694.3623222).

All datasets are contained within the data/ folder. The scripts get_data_< > prepare each dataset. The rest of the scripts are within the src/ folder. The scripts get_cf_data_< > generate the counterfactual dataset for the < > case. In the case for the law school data, a second get_cf_data_ script is used for the intersectional discrimination case (denoted by _int). For this dataset, in particular, we generate the counterfactual dataset in R to be able to compare the more 'frequentist' and 'Bayesian' approaches for the abduction step. The latter approach uses RStan to run a MCMC. The scripts run_exp_< > run the experiments for the < > case. Finally, the scripts analysis_< > contain the additional analysis (e.g., relevant figures) performed on the < > case. Results fall within the results/ folder.
